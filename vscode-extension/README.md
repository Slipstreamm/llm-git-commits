# LLM Git Commits VS Code Extension

This extension integrates the `llm-git-commits` command line tool with Visual Studio Code. It can generate commit messages using an LLM and let you commit directly from the editor.

## Usage

1. Run the `LLM Git: Generate Commit` command from the Command Palette.
2. A preview webview shows the proposed commit message.
3. Click **Commit** to finalize the commit or **Cancel** to close.

The extension assumes that the `llm-git-commits` CLI is installed and available on your `PATH`.
